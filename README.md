## Introduction

**BotCore** is a backend framework designed to support the development and deployment of multiple Discord bots. It provides a scalable and secure environment by implementing a **Security Service** that manages API keys for each bot, ensuring controlled access to its functionalities.

The framework integrates multiple services to extend the capabilities of Discord bots:
- **Security Service**: Handles API key generation and authentication for bots.
- **Music Service**: Enables music-related features such as playlists, song metadata retrieval, and engagement tracking.
- **Game Service**: Provides League of Legends-related functionalities, including match management and player statistics.

**BotCore** is written in **Java** and is designed to be deployed using **Docker**, making it easy to manage and scale multiple Discord bots efficiently.

You can find an integration of this backend in a Discord bot written in Python here: [BotX](https://github.com/e-honceriu/BotX).
